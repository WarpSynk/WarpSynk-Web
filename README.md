WarpSynk Protocol

Universal Decentralized Data Sync Layer for Web2 and Web3

Overview

WarpSynk is a decentralized protocol for secure and verifiable data synchronization. It connects applications across Web2 and Web3 using Proof of Sync (PoSync), encrypted channels, and incentive-driven node infrastructure.

The protocol is designed for developers, communities, and enterprises that need reliable, censorship-resistant, and privacy-first data layers.

Key Features

Proof of Sync (PoSync) – Lightweight consensus for real-time data synchronization.

SynkNodes – Client software for desktop, mobile, and server environments.

SynkVault – End-to-end encrypted and zero-knowledge data channels.

$WSYNK Token – Powers staking, incentives, and WarpDAO governance.

SynkPass NFTs – Identity and access layer for node participation and governance.

WarpAPI Gateway – REST, GraphQL, and WebSocket APIs for seamless Web2 integration.
